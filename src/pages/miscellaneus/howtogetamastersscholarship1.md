<center><h1>An experience on how to get a Master's Scholarship: Part 1</h1></center>
<hr>

This is the first part of a series of posts where I will be sharing my process on how I applied for several scholarships and Master's degrees, and how I was able to be granted an Erasmus Mundus scholarship. I hope these posts help you at least a little if you're planning to study abroad, especially if you are a Latin American student or professional.  
We will first discuss why should someone pursue a Master's degree and the preparation before even applying to any program.

<h3>Travelling back in time</h3>
<br/>
Let's go back a few years, back when I was still a freshman in college. I had recently chosen my major in Software Engineering and was notoriously happy about my decision. Coding, computers and software had always been my passion and finally I had the chance to learn the ways of a developer (read this with a Jedi voice). Being a padawan myself, I still had the chance to explore different fields in SE before graduating. However, in 3rd semester I realised that even after graduating, I wanted to prepare even more, and become an expert in whichever field I picked.  
I have always been a learner and an advocate for formal education, even though my position has relaxed in the past years, since I discovered self-paced learning with online courses and certifications, which is another great way of becoming an expert at something. For me though, the thought of going to graduate school was always a dream and an objective since college.

<h3>Decide your reasons</h3>
<br/>
First step is deciding whether graduate school is something you really want to pursue, and make a plan to accomplish the first objectives towards the goal. This stage ideally happens between college and after getting your first job. Please keep in mind that everyone has their own list of objectives, but in general they are:
- <b>Keep a good GPA.</b> This one is often undervalued by some people, as it is true that most companies don't really pay attention to your GPA (this is debatable). On the other hand, any renowned graduate program will require you to have a good enough GPA. Depending on the programs of your like, keep this in mind. In Mexico, our system gives you grades between 0 and 100 or between 0 and 10. The passing mark is 70 in many universities and a good GPA is often above 90. This is the equivalent of having at least a A- or A average in your grades. A strong GPA can make the difference in the admission process for a Master's.
- <b>Network. </b> With your classmates and with your professors. Remember everything is key to building your portfolio. Engage in student clubs, sports activities. Any extracurricular activity will greatly help you!
- <b>Discover your passion!</b> This one is the most important. Try to list the fields you like the most and the ones you like the least in your degree. Some people go for Networks, others like to specialize in Devops, and then there's people like me who like to play with Big Data. Once you have defined two or three fields of your interest, try to keep excellent grades on the courses related to said fields.
- <b>Get experience.</b> Usually this point will be the game-changer between getting a scholarship or not. If possible, enroll in internships even if they are unpaid (which sucks, I know, but you'll get some experience). A good 2 or 3 years of experience are really attractive for selection commitees. If you're already finished with college, your first job should (ideally) be specifically related to the master's you want to study. This is what I thought when I decided to get my first job as a Data Analyst. Keep in mind that some positions are entry-level and senior-level positions often will require you to have certain certifications or a master's degree. For instance, a Data Analyst is often an entry-level position, and afterwards you can evolve to be a Data Scientist, Data Engineer, or ML Engineer, depending on your skills, your role at the company and the certifications/master's you decide to pursue.

Let me finish the list by stressing that even if at some point you discover that you don't like your area of expertise anymore, there is always time to change! Especially if you are still in college. Keep it calm and adjust your plan.

<h3>So...is graduate school for me?</h3>
<br/>
As you might have noticed, these series of steps begin many years prior to even applying to graduate school. If your degree and areas of interest are research-intensive and highly technical, and you are a person who is interested in getting to know many different cultures (a must nowadays), likes formal methods of education, and is generally keen to go back to the old school days, then you should seriously consider studying a master's degree.
