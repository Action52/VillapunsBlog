<h4>A little about myself</h4>
<br/>
Hi! My name is Alfredo León. I'm a Software Engineer (class of 2019), proud graduate from Tecnológico de Monterrey Campus Puebla. My passion for Big Data led me to accept my first job as a Data Analyst for the past 3 years at Verato, an identity resolution company based at Washington, DC in the United States and at Mérida in México.

<h4>Professional Career</h4>
<br/>
As I said above, I studied my bachelor's in Software Engineering at ITESM Campus Puebla (Mexico's top 1 private university). Around one year before finishing the bachelor's, I discovered my interest in the field of Data Science and Data Engineering. I noticed that these fields were going to change the world in the decades to come, and I decided to build my professional carreer around them mainly because of the following reasons.
<br/>
- <b>These fields are a reality and will rule mankind's progress for the next decades.</b> One of my bucket list's purposes is to contribute somehow to mankind's progress and evolution. What a better place to contribute to this than building big data pipelines or discovering patterns with data science algorithms?
- <b>I am passionate about my work.</b> As many of the interviewee's in David Rubinstein's "How to Lead" say, the key to succeed on whatever you do is having a true passion about what you do. I was very lucky to discover this passion early on my career. First, I discovered I loved coding and software, then, I found out that I enjoyed applying this knowledge to build big data infrastructure and to work with data science.
- <b>When I was little I always said I wanted to become a scientist. </b> When I was a little 5-year-old I wanted to be 2 things: an astronaut or a scientist. Well, some might say that being an engineer is nowhere close to being a scientist, but definitely becoming a data scientist will make little me proud. As for the astronaut part, I'm still dreaming that someday I will become one.
<br/>
In February 2022 I was awarded a full-time, fully-paid Erasmus scholarship to study my master's in Europe. The Master's is called: MS. Big Data Management and Analytics. I'm expected to start the courses in September 2022 and finish around September 2024.

<h4>My hobbies and personal interests</h4>
<br/>
Let me talk about my passions outside the office. I'm a sports person, specifically team sports. I like them because one of my core values is believing that through having a common goal and vision, a team of people can achieve great things.  
My favorite sports are soccer and basketball. Mainly I support Liverpool FC and Puebla FC in soccer, and the Miami Heat in basketball. I also enjoy jogging and running. I've run the 5k and 10k multiple times with a very average time, but I really enjoy the freedom of running and feeling a human being.  
My other passion is chess. I love playing chess on my free time. Even though I'm a pretty average player, I had the chance to be a team member of my university's chess team from 2017 to 2019, which was an awesome experience.

I'd say my other hobbies are reading and watching movies. I'll try to post often in this webpage my opinions on the books and movies I like (or not). I'm a history nerd, so any recommendations on historical books are always welcome. For the movies, you'll always get me with a good space sci-fi movie.
